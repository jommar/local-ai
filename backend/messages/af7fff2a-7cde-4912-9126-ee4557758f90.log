Want to test my knowledge on a specific subject?\n3. **Language understanding**: We can test my ability to understand natural language by giving me a sentence or phrase and seeing if I get it right.\n\nWhich one of these ideas sounds interesting to you, or do you have something else in mind?"

For example:\n\n* We could play a game of \"20 Questions\" where you think of an object and I try to guess what it is.\n* You could give me a prompt or scenario and see how well I respond.\n* Or we could try to solve a problem together.\n\nWhat do you say?"
